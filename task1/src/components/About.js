      <p>
        Hello! I'm John Doe, a full-stack web developer based in San Francisco,
        CA. I have a passion for coding and love to learn new technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have expertise in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I'm also
        familiar with Python and Django. I love the logic and structure of
        coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you'll find me outdoors. I enjoy hiking, biking,
        and photography.
      </p>
